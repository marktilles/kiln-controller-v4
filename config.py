# Hardware Setup (uses BCM Pin Numbering)
#
# kiln-controller.py uses SPI interface from the blinka library to read
# temperature data from the adafruit-31855 or adafruit-31856.
# Blinka supports many different boards. I've only tested raspberry pi.
#
# First you must decide whether to use hardware spi or software spi.
# 
# Hardware SPI
#
# - faster
# - requires 3 specific GPIO pins be used on rpis
# - no pins are listed in this config file 
# 
# Software SPI
#
# - slower (which will not matter for reading a thermocouple
# - can use any GPIO pins
# - pins must be specified in this config file

#######################################
# SPI pins if you choose Hardware SPI #
#######################################
# On the raspberry pi, you MUST use predefined
# pins for HW SPI. In the case of the adafruit-31855, only 3 pins are used:
#
#    SPI0_SCLK = BCM pin 11 = CLK on the adafruit-31855
#    SPI0_MOSI = BCM pin 10 = not connected
#    SPI0_MISO = BCM pin 9  = D0 on the adafruit-31855
#   
# plus a GPIO output to connect to CS. You can use any GPIO pin you want.
# I chose gpio pin 5:
#
#    GPIO5    = BCM pin 5   = CS on the adafruit-31855
#
# Note that NO pins are configured in this file for hardware spi

#######################################
# SPI pins if you choose software spi #
#######################################
# For software SPI, you can choose any GPIO pins you like.
# You must connect clock, mosi, miso and cs each to a GPIO pin
# and configure them below based on your connections.

#######################################
# SPI is Autoconfigured !!!
#######################################
# whether you choose HW or SW spi, it is autodetected. If you list the PINs
# below, software spi is assumed.
